// WINDOW DARK MODE + COLORS EXTENSIONS V3.0 - Made by T-Bar //

Well, this is probably the final update before this code (and more) will be
added to Ghostutil V3.


                          --  NEW TO 3.0  --

Here are the features new to 3.0:

-Removed any instance of runHaxeCode, making the script able to run on
 ALL Psych Engine versions with lua support again.

-Added a new function: `setWindowTitleColor()`, a function that allows you
 to modify the window's title text color, originally exclusive to Ghostutil v3.

-All functions, except for the Windows 11 exclusive functions, no longer use
 the AddressParser lib and can now run without it, just incase you are having
 trouble with it and only want to set the border to dark mode.

-The AddressParser.dll library is now in the same folder as the WindowColorMode.lua
 script. 
 (Example: if the script path is `mods/scripts/WindowColorMode.lua`, then the lib
  must be in `mods/scripts/include/AddressParser.dll`)

                           -- INSTRUCTIONS --

1: Unzip the contents of the zip file. (duh)

2: Add the WindowColorMode.lua script in the scripts folder or a song specific folder.

3: Add the `include` folder containing the AddressParser lib into the same directory as
   the WindowColorMode.lua script (example is above in the "NEW TO 3.0" category).

4: Currently the template code inside the script will turn the window dark mode and will switch
   back after the song is over. You can edit the section under the extra code section, near the bottom.


                              -- EXTRAS --

 - `setWindowBorderColor` and `setWindowTitleColor` only works for Windows 11 machines. This is due to multiple 
    color support being added started from Win 11.

 - Do not remove the include folder from your modpack / mods folder, it is a library that is used to convert
   certain variables to their addresses. Removing it will make all Windows 11 functions not work.
   If you (for some reason) are not comfortable using the AddressParser.dll, then use the old version of the
   script here: https://gamebanana.com/scripts/12145 (OR use the regular color mode functions only)

 - The functions in this script will eventually be added to Ghost Utilities V3 along with a new lua module
   (https://github.com/AlsoGhostglowDev/Ghost-s-Utilities).

 - Check out the haxelib version for if you want to use this code in a source code project `https://lib.haxe.org/p/hxWindowColorMode/`.
